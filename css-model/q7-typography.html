            <h1>The Art of Web Typography</h1>
            
            <p class="intro">
                Typography is a crucial aspect of web design that significantly impacts readability, 
                user experience, and overall aesthetic appeal. <strong>Good typography</strong> can transform 
                a simple webpage into an engaging and visually pleasing experience.

            <h2>Understanding Font Families</h2>
            
            <p>
                Choosing the right font family is the first step in creating effective typography. 
                There are several categories of fonts, each with its own characteristics and use cases:
            </p>
            
            <h3>Serif Fonts</h3>
            <p>
                Serif fonts have small lines or strokes attached to the ends of letters. 
                They are often considered more traditional and are commonly used in printed materials. 
                Examples include <em>Times New Roman</em>, Georgia, and Garamond.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Sans-serif Fonts</h3>
            <p>
                Sans-serif fonts do not have the small lines or strokes at the ends of letters. 
                They appear cleaner and more modern, making them popular for digital displays. 
                Popular choices include Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Font Weights and Sizes</h2>
            
            <p>
                Font weight refers to the thickness of the characters. The <mark>font-weight</mark> property 
                allows you to control this aspect, with values ranging from 100 (thin) to 900 (extra bold). 
                The default value is 400, which corresponds to normal weight.
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form." 
                - Robert Bringhurst
            </blockquote>
            
            <h2>Line Height and Spacing</h2>
            
            <p>
                Proper line height (or leading) is essential for readability. The <mark>line-height</mark> 
                property controls the vertical spacing between lines of text. A good rule of thumb is to 
                set line height to 1.4 to 1.6 times the font size for body text.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Letter spacing (or tracking) can also affect readability. The <mark>letter-spacing</mark> 
                property adjusts the space between characters. For most body text, the default spacing 
                works well, but headings might benefit from slight adjustments.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Text Alignment and Balance</h2>
            
            <p>
                Text alignment plays a significant role in the visual balance of a webpage. 
                The <mark>text-align</mark> property can be set to left, right, center, or justify. 
                For readability, left-aligned text is generally preferred for body content in 
                left-to-right languages.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Creating visual hierarchy through typography helps guide readers through content. 
                This can be achieved through varying font sizes, weights, and colors. 
                <em>Consistency</em> in typographic choices throughout a website creates a 
                cohesive and professional appearance.
