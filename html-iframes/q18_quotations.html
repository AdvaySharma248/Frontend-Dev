    <h2>Blockquote and Inline Quote</h2>

    <p>
        When discussing web development, it's important to remember what experts say.
        As one developer noted, <q>Code is read more often than it is written, so &amp; clarity is key.</q>
        This principle applies everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the topic of HTML itself, the W3C provides clear guidance:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community
        where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public
        work together to develop Web standards.
