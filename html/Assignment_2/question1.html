    <h1>Advay Sharma</h1>
    <p>
        I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student with strong skills in programming, problem-solving, and web development. I have experience working with languages such as Java, C, C++, and Python, and I am currently advancing my knowledge in Java, Data Structures & Algorithms, and full-stack development.

        I enjoy building projects that are practical and user-friendly, and I have hands-on experience with frontend and backend development, as well as working on portfolio and UX/UI projects. I am also skilled in gaming, coding, and sports, which have helped me develop discipline, strategic thinking, and teamwork.
        
        I am eager to contribute my technical skills and creativity to real-world projects, collaborate with teams, and continuously grow as a developer.    </p>
